Wireframing

- Wireframing is a sketched framework or blueprint of a product that shows the key components
 and layout structure of the product you want to develop, bringing an idea to a tangible representation

Importance of wireframing

- Wireframing is important because it clarifies the idea early in the design process showing the layout structure
 and key components which will act as guide in the development stage. It also facilitates better communication with
 the team because with a wireframe you can show what you are trying to communicate whether its changes you want to
make or component you want to add. Wireframing shows usability issues before enetering the development stage which
will save time and resources, it also provides easy modification and guides the development stage.

Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure
  * Having a blueprint representation of a layout structure is important because it defines the arrangement of the elements
    on the page which can help developers visualize and decide on content placement, and decide whether to use CSS Grids or
    Flexbox.
    
- Navigation
  * Navigation is part of the user experience so wireframing helps developers identify what hinders a user from finding their
    way around the application.
    
- Content Placement
  * Wireframing helps you identify where its best to position the content based on hierachy and the relationship between the
    colors, images and information.
    
- Functionality
  * Wireframing helps you outline key functionalities and interactions on the application in its early stages. Its helps developers
    see how the end user will interact with the application and gives developers ideas to design the interactions to achieve a
    particular goal for example call to action buttons and how users will know whether they have clicked or hovered over a button
    or not.

 Types of Wireframes

 There are typically two types of wireframes, low fidelity and high fidelity wireframes. Low fidelity is a simple sketched blueprint of a product
 that has minimal design details and only focusing on the overall structure typically used at the early stages of design. High fidelity is a more detailed design blueprint  with  a specific layout and design elements typically used at the end of the design stage closer to the development stage.
