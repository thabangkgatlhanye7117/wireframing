Wireframing
- Wireframing is a sketched framework or blueprint of a product that shows the key components
 and layout structure of the product you want to develop, bringing an idea to a tangible representation

Importance of wireframing
- Wireframing is important because it clarifies the idea early in the design process showing the layout structure
 and key components which will act as guide in the development stage. It also facilitates better communication with
 the team because with a wireframe you can show what you are trying to communicate whether its changes you want to
make or component you want to add. Wireframing shows usability issues before enetering the development stage which
will save time and resources, it also provides easy modification and guides the development stage.
